Starting Page:

        Greet pookie with a cute message
        Then have a selection of 25/5, 30/10 and 45/15 in the form of nice buttons in a row
        After a button gets selected then redirect to a new page with the timer

        Buttons can/should have different looks or colors
    
    
Main Page:

        After the timer gets selected it switches to the new page and starts the timer after a few seconds (short delay)
        The page should look aesthetic so...

            Left side: Cool image, with the theme of the button from the previous page
            Right side:
                Top: "Do Not Disturb" or just some saying -> Make that curved
                Bottom: Big Countdown, Minutes number and below it says minutes, seconds number and below it says seconds

        When the timer is done there should be a ring sound "bingggg" and the page inverts...

            Right side: Cool image but a new one, with the theme of the button from the previous page
            Left side:
                Top: "Take a break!" or just some saying -> Make that curved
                Bottom: Big Countdown, Minutes number and below it says minutes, seconds number and below it says seconds

        The entire time there should be lofi music playing
        
        And from time to time there should be motivation on the screen
